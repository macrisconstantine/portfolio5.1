# portfolio5.1
- The first of a series of trivial exercises comprising the stepping stones to learning how to develop functional webpages.
- Uploading individual exercises to github was part of the assignment.
- This exercise creates a bare webpage that provides an input field for a number and a button to find the prime numbers < the input number.
- Test the page directly in the website link, or download this repo zip, extract the files, and open the index.html file.
